           "<p class=\"cv-short-desc\">I am a trans-disciplinary researcher focusing on understanding the fundamental mechanisms that determine how our social interactions facilitate the spread of infectious diseases and consequently, how we can mitigate their dispersal. Originally being trained in statistical physics, I employ methods from non-linear dynamics, complexity science, data science, and statistics incl. machine learning.</p><p class=\"cv-short-desc\">During the last years, I was able to contribute to Germany's response to the COVID-19 pandemic by conducting infectious disease modeling research at Robert Koch Institute. At the moment, I hold a postdoc position at DTU Copenhagen and Danmarks Statistiks to research how socio-economical factors determine individual health from large-scale public data sets.</p><p class=\"cv-short-desc\">I am interested in finding new ways to collect and analyze social behavorial and epidemiological data to improve predictions of infectious disease outbreaks and facilitate decision-making for rapid responses. My aim is to establish &ldquo;complex systems&rdquo; methods in public health contexts by teaching students as well as collaborating in joint social/health research ventures.</p>"
